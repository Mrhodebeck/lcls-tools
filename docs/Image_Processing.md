# Image Processing
------------------

## About
The Image Processing package takes an electron beam image .mat file and turns it into a python data object. The goal of this package is to analyze and describe an electron beam image, which allows a glimps into the size of the beam and also can be used to calculate the emittance.

----------------------------
## Image Processing Analysis
The image processing analysis utility had several functions that can be used to analyze the elecron beam images. These functions include flipping the image, shaping the image, finding the center of the image, and other functions that can be found useful. This utility can be found [here](https://github.com/slaclab/lcls-tools/blob/python3devel/lcls_tools/image_processing/image_processing.py).
