# Beam Calculations

## About
The Solenoid is a lense inside the LCLS that is used to correct the momentum of the individual electrons that compose the electron beam. This is crucial to maintaining the size and shape of the beam. Therefore, the solenoid lowers the emittance and allows for a better stabilized beam. 

## Solenoid Calculation Package
The goal of this utility is to collect data from the electron beam as it passes through the solenoid and use that data to calculate how the solenoid should be positioned to create the lowest possible emittance. This package, found [here](https://github.com/slaclab/lcls-tools/tree/python3devel/lcls_tools/beam_calcs/sol_calc), is currently under development.

More packages to come.
